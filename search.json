    "text": "Understand the concept of physical storage of data.\nUnderstand the concept of logical representation of data.\nUnderstand the difference between physical storage and logical representation.\n\n\n\n\n\nDefine and explain the concept of physical storage using platform storage accounts as examples.\nDefine and explain the concept of logical representation using views in Synapse as examples.\nDifferentiate between files in their raw formats in physical storage and cleaned, wrangled files in logical representation.\n\n\n\n\nPhysical data storage refers to the tangible means by which data is stored in digital form, on devices like hard drives, Flash storage, memory cards, DVDs, etc. When relating this to a storage account platform such as Sandbox Lake Broad, the data is physically stored as files within the cloud storage. These files are kept in containers, which form the primary component of the platform’s data storage architecture. Data here is raw and untransformed, thus may require additional processing steps for optimal use.\n\n\n\nContrary to physical data storage, logical representation of data abstracts the underlying complexity of physical storage. It concerns the way data is perceived from a user’s point of view, invariably hiding intricate lower-level details. For instance, in Synapse, users interact with a logical representation of the data - a structured, cleaned, and organised ‘view’ - rather than dealing directly with the physical storage. The underlying technology enables users to manipulate, search, and retrieve the data without needing extensive comprehension of how and where the data is physically stored.\n\n\n\nPhysical and logical data representations stand as complementary aspects of data storage and management.\nPhysical storage pertains to raw data files kept on some hardware or cloud-based platform. It does not concern itself with data’s meaningfulness or organisation - it’s fundamentally about ensuring data is stored, intact and accessible when required.\nOn the other hand, logical representation is about bringing ‘sense’ and ‘meaning’ to that stored data. It presents the data in an organised, often simplified form, making it easy for users to interact with and utilise the data.\nThink of physical representation as the warehouse storing boxes of raw materials (data), and the logical representation as the display in a store - sorted, arranged, and ready for consumers (users) to browse and purchase.\nRemember that comprehending both concepts is vital in understanding data management as a whole. They form the building blocks of data storage; understanding their synergy will guide you in leveraging the power of data effectively and efficiently.\nWe hope this lesson provided a foundational understanding of physical and logical data representation. Stay tuned for our upcoming lessons, which will delve deeper into different aspects of data management."
