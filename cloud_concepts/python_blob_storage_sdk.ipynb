    "How to download files from Azure Blob Storage in the QESD Platform using Python in a local IDE\n",
    "\n",
    "To access files stored in Azure Blob Storage within the QESD Platform from a local IDE (such as Visual Studio Code), you need to set up authentication. Azure offers various authentication methods for accessing resources. In the QESD Platform, the preferred authentication method for most users is through Microsoft Entra ID (previously known as Azure Active Directory - Azure AD). Check out the BlobServiceClient class in the azure.storage.blob to explore other features such as writing and uploading blobs to a storage account. \n",
